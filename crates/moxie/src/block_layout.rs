//! Lays a scene's [`Block`] tree out as nested boxes, not one flat
//! row per node. A block is a bordered container spanning its time
//! range, holding its children as filled bars (actions) or nested
//! containers (blocks).
//!
//! Horizontal position always comes straight from a node's resolved
//! start time ([`TimelineView`]). Nesting only affects the vertical
//! axis: a block's box literally encloses its children's boxes,
//! rather than implying the relationship through indentation.
