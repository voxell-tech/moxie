//! The backend-agnostic core of the fynix rewrite prototype, see
//! `docs/fynix_rewrite.md`.
//!
//! Views are structs that own their own props and hold other views
//! whole. Set rules restyle every view of a kind within a scope, a
//! call-site value beats any rule, and whatever is left unset falls
//! back to the theme. Elements whose props can change stay mounted, and
//! travel to new values over a transition when asked to.
//!
//! Nothing here names an engine. A [`Backend`] says what a world and a
//! node are, and a backend crate writes the elements.
